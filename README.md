# Node-Server
This application is a simple node server running on the command line to be able to see the simple setup of creating a node server on the 
terminal being used for the application. The user will have to clone the repo to their device, then run npm install to create the node
package manager for the folder. Once that is installed the user needs to run an npm install fs to be able to have the readFile package
installed into the npm. Then the user runs node server to be able to view the content on the local host of the device. Enjoy!!
